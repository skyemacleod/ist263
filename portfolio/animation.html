        <p class="anime-text">08.07.25 // I woke up at 6:15am. I was up so early because of a special pillow gifted to me by my brother. I flossed and wrote my todo list and crossed two things off my list before departing to do "errands". I didn't have work today so I planned to make the most of it, even though I should be doing that everyday. I drove myself to La Mulita and got a coffee that wasn't as good as my one yesterday, still good, just not yummy. I then drove into Portsmouth and picked up Nic's stuff he left at Sunnys for him. I made my way home, taking a long route by the beach, enjoying my music but not as much as I could be if my speakers would go louder and I couldn't hear myself sing. FOr this personal choice and other choices combined the police told me I needed to slow down, as I came to a hurrling stop in front of them, he was kind, I was reckless. I made my way home and hopped on my zoom call with Kendall for WhatsApp, I kinda hope I get it just so I have some money flowing in, didn't sound to hard either. I chatted with Evelyn and her mom for a minute then got one the phone with Opehlia, taking Coach out and walking laps around the tennis court as we spoke. Claps. I then clearly lolligagged because I have no recollection of what I did after. I think I opened VSCode. As I was playing on the couch Tim came in, then Michaela, then my mum. I was starved. </p>
