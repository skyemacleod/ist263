        <p class="anime-text">08.07.25 // I woke up at 6:15am. I was up so early because of a special pillow gifted to me by my brother. I flossed and wrote my todo list and crossed two things off my list before departing to do "errands". I didn't have work today so I planned to make the most of it, even though I should be doing that everyday. I drove myself to La Mulita and got a coffee that wasn't as good as my one yesterday, still good, just not yummy. I then drove into Portsmouth and picked up Nic's stuff he left at Sunnys for him. I made my way home, taking a long route by the beach, enjoying my music but not as much as I could be if my speakers would go louder and I couldn't hear myself sing. FOr this personal choice and other choices combined the police told me I needed to slow down, as I came to a hurrling stop in front of them, he was kind, I was reckless. I made my way home and hopped on my zoom call with Kendall for WhatsApp, I kinda hope I get it just so I have some money flowing in, didn't sound to hard either. I chatted with Evelyn and her mom for a minute then got one the phone with Opehlia, taking Coach out and walking laps around the tennis court as we spoke. Claps. I then clearly lolligagged because I have no recollection of what I did after. I think I opened VSCode. As I was playing on the couch Tim came in, then Michaela, then my mum. I was starved. </p>

        <p class="just">I'm a Senior at Syracuse University studying Information Management & Technology and Marketing. I'm born and raised on the coast of New Hampshire with my twin brother and older sister. I want to move to the city once I graduate but I also don't wanna wish away time, becuase as fun as I know postgrad will be, there's nothing like the life at college, living with your best friends a walks distance from anything or anyone you could ever desire. I've always had an incline towards creation, beginning with MovieStar evolving to YouTube videos, now maturing into coding html and css.</p>
