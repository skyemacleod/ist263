        My name is Skye MacLeod, I am currently a Junior at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management and Technology with minors in Marketing and Public Communications. Iâ€™m interested in studying data related to retail enterprises and fashion. I have learned to use Python and SQL. Some of my favorite hobbies are walking, dancing, cheffing, and hanging out with my friends. I have a twin brother who goes to University of Denver and an older sister who graduated from Syracuse in 2023.
