                <p>
                    I'm a Junior at Syracuse University studying Information Management & Technology in the iSchool with a double minor in Marketing and Public Communications. For one of my classes this semester, Intro to Front-End Web Development (IST263), we were assigned a final project, to create a website of our choice. Welcome to my final project. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From a young age I've loved with creating content, initially beginning with YouTube videos. As I've grown up, especially through college taking courses like IST263,  my creations have evolved to more technically sophisticated projects, like websites, platforms that not only tell stories but also collect, organize, and analyze data.

                    <br>
                    With my background in Technology, Marketing, and Communications, I'm interested in the way data can shape how we connect with consumers, particularly in the retail, fashion, and entertainment industries.  I’m fascinated by how data insights can shape user experiences, optimize marketing strategies, and inspire design decisions—bringing together creativity and analytics.

                    <br>
                    This website is a reflection of that intersection: a project blending the art of design with the power of data, all while continuing to fuel my passion for creating engaging digital experiences.
